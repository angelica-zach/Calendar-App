# Calendar-App

## Description

In this project, i made a calendar app using jquery and time APIs. The time and date were gotten from the dayjs() API and then formatted. The layout was made using bootstrap. There is also local storage for the save button . For ease of use, the date blocks are colour coded, with gray meaning past events, and therefore unimportant , red meaning now and green meaning future. The calendar has time blocks from 9-17 mimicing a traditional workday
